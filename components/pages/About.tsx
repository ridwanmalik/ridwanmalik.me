              Hello! I&apos;m Ridwan, and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web
              development started back in 2018 when I decided to try building my first website â€” turns out learning HTML
              & CSS taught me a lot about frontend development!
            </p>

            <p>
              Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had the privilege of working at various companies, from startups to
              established businesses. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
              experiences for a variety of clients.
            </p>

            <p>
              I recently started studying Computer Science and Engineering at Bangladesh University of Business and
              Technology, while continuing to work as a Software Developer. I&apos;m passionate about learning new
              technologies and solving complex problems.
            </p>

            <div>
              I specialize in building applications with <TechWithHoverCard text="React" />,{" "}
              <TechWithHoverCard text="Next.js" />, and <TechWithHoverCard text="Laravel" />, creating both frontend
              interfaces and robust backend systems. My experience spans from <TechWithHoverCard text="JavaScript" />{" "}
              and <TechWithHoverCard text="PHP" /> development to <TechWithHoverCard text="Node.js" /> server
              applications and <TechWithHoverCard text="MySQL" /> database design.
