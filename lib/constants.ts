// This block is length-critical: the resume is designed to fit on one page, and the job

// its own tipped the resume to two pages; dropping "Ionic" (still evidenced by the Dream
// Diver bullet) bought the room back. Re-check the PDF page count after any addition
// here, and read the generated text layer, not just the rendered page.
